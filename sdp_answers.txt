When adding matrices, what must be true about the matrices in order for the addition to be successful?
They must be the same size.
When multiplying matrices, what must be true about the matrices in order for the multiplication to be successful?
The n value of the first matrix must be the same as the m value of the second
When multiplying matrices, what information can we use to determine the size of the resulting matrix?
the m of the first and the n of the second
When working with matrices we need to use nested loops. During matrix multiplication, how many iterations does the outer loop need to complete? What about the inner loop? Relate your responses to the size of some matrices A and B.
The outer loop will need m of the first list and the inner loop will need n of the second list iterations.
When populating your solution matrix, we will need to move between rows and columns effortlessly while never exceeding the dimensions of the matrix. What tool can we use to prevent our indexes from exceeding the bounds of the matrix?
for loops
